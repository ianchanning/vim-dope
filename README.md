For those who love Tim Pope's plugins, this should give you a rush. 

For anyone starting out with Vim, this is a great set of lightweight plugins. It puts the batteries in without sticking lead on top.

* [Pathogen][1] - Plugins
* [Sensible][2] - Vim defaults
* [Obsession][3] - Save your Session (`:help Session`)
* [Fugitive][4] - Managing Git
* [Vinegar][5] - Better use of the in-built file explorer (`:help netrw`)
* [Surround][6] - Surround selections with brackets or characters
* [Unimpaired][7] - Switching buffers, lines, etc
* [Commentary][8] - Commenting lines
* [Repeat][9] - Repeat Surround and Unimpaired actions

## Pope-Promotion

Like these plugins? Follow the relevant repository on GitHub and vote for it on [vim.org][10]. And if you're feeling especially charitable, follow [tpope][11] on [Twitter][12] and [GitHub][13].

## Pssst...

FZF, Ripgrep and ALE are pretty awesome too.

Buffers (`:help windows`) [are your friend][14].
